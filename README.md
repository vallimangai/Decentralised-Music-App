# Decentralised Music App - SMART MUSIC APP USING BLOCKCHAIN  
The aim is to allow musicians and distributors to share details of rights and royalties for music tracks online. These smart contracts automatically license recordings and take payment each time they are played.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55653139/230835656-87d286fa-a3a5-4817-b5c7-da3aa12ea699.png)

## Working of websites
The results of our decentralized royalty-based music application showed promising potential for the implementation of blockchain technology and smart contracts in the music industry. By utilizing IPFS to store and distribute music files, we were able to create a decentralized platform that allows artists to directly receive royalties for their music without the need for intermediaries or third-party payment processors.
Our implementation used a smart contract to automatically distribute royalties based on the number of streams and the agreed upon percentage split between the artists involved in creating the song. The use of smart contracts ensures that payments are transparent and fair, while also reducing the risk of fraudulent activity. Below images shows working of our website
